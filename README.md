# LEOS in stages

This repo takes the LEOS project (https://github.com/fanjum11/leos) and breaks it down into 8 modules.

Each successive module builds on the previous one.

The goal is to demonstrate to the reader how a complete Clarity smart contract is created.

A side effect of this is also to help analyze the code for bugs etc.
